# Looping Louie

The children's game Looping Louie gets boring fast, especially when the same person keeps winning all the time. To spice things up a bit, I added a microcontroller and a H-bridge to drive the motor. With the code in this repository, Louie can not only randomly change speed, but also perform some wicked flight manoeuvres. Nobody is safe any more, even the most skilled player has no chance sometimes.
